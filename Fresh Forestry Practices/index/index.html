As you go through each stage, you learn more about the fundamental stages of each forest: Stand Initiation, Stem Exclusion, Understory Reinitiation, and Old Growth.</p>

            <h2>1) Stand Initiation</h2>
            <p>The <mark>Stand Initiation Stage</mark> is the first stage after a major disturbance, and in this case, a forest fire. Within this stage, there is regeneration of open space from seed sprouts. Also known as the bushy stage, Stand Initiation is characterized by shrubs and tree sprouts. This invasion of shrubs and tree sprouts continues until all growing space is occupied.</p>

            <h3>Restoration of Riparian Forests</h3>
            
            <!--// Image-->
            <div>
                <p>The goal of Riparian restoration is to reach the Fully Functional developmental stage of riparian forests. This is a traditionally slow process that can take up to 400 years. </p>

                <p>Optimal Riparian forest functioning requires three primary characteristics: <b>large conifer trees, a complex stand structure, and diverse species composition.</b> In Riparian forests, long-living tree species provide stability and support stream banks, channels, and floodplains. </p>
                <p>Large trees are <u>essential</u> for effective restoration as they provide critical structure and prevent erosion of soil and water-banks.</p>

            <div>
                <p>Riparian zones are well known for influencing many ecological processes at local to landscape scales, and fire can have an important ecosystem-scale influence on them.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, Riparian zones can act as a buffer against fire and therefore as a refuge for fire-sensitive species. </p>

            <h2>2) Stem Exclusion</h2>
            <p>This stage occurs as soon as all growing space is occupied and new plants are excluded from regenerating. At first, the different trees occupy a single layer, or stratum—a condition referred to as the “Brushy Stage." Within Stem Exclusion, the canopy is too dense to allow new saplings to grow in the canopy, and the canopy continues to have one cohort. Competition is intense and density-dependent. The Stem Exclusion Stage is characterized by growth, competition, and mortality produced spatial adjustments.</p>
